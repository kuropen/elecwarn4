# Electricity Warning Crawler, Version 4

This is the crawler of Electricity Warning project. 
Gathering data about usage of electricity in Japan.

This version is to be coupled with Japan Electricity Dashboard,
which is now under development by the author.
All area information is now read from the JED GraphQL server,
to which crawled data is sent, hence this crawler is unable to run standalone.
